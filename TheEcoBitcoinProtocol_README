EcoBitcoin ($ECOBTC) is the first community-driven and eco-friendly Bitcoin combined with innovative tokenomics and a revolutionary new AirMining process. The EcoBitcoin Protocol was created by the anonymous developer and/or development team EcoSatoshi Nakamoto, and was designed to greatly increase in value over time due to its deflationary mechanisms and custom tokenomics.

Our mission is to support the vast adoption of renewable and environmentally-friendly cryptocurrency mining, as well as meet the present and future needs of Planet Earth as the most eco-friendly Bitcoin option. We plan on not only educating society about the environmental impact of everyday assets; our goal is to become part of the ecological solution.

About Binance Smart Chain:
Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was chosen as the network for EcoBitcoin due to its much more environmentally-friendly Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) consensus; PoSA greatly differs from Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm which relies on Miners using massive amounts of computer power to solve complex mathematical equations.

Binance Smart Chain is a rapidly growing and extremely popular blockchain which branched off from Binance Coin (BNB) in 2019, and is known for its low fees, fast transaction speeds, eco-friendly consensus algorithm, and superior scalability.

What is AirMining?
EcoBitcoin uses a revolutionary new eco-friendly mining process termed AirMining, where every buy, sell, and transfer transaction AirMines (or auto-redistributes) coins to existing holders through the use of transaction fees. The more EcoBitcoin you hold in your wallet, the more $ECOBTC you AirMine and earn from every single transaction.

AirMining is environmentally-friendly, simple and requires no technical set-up unlike traditional PoW (Proof of Work) mining that uses massive amounts of computer power and has advanced technical equipment/knowledge required.

About Burning Coins/Tokens:
Burning a coin or token means that you are sending coins or tokens to an inoperable and inaccessible ‚ÄúDead Address‚Äù or ‚ÄúBurn Wallet.‚Äù This makes the price of every remaining coin or token that much more valuable in the long-term, and through the use of auto-redistribution and transaction fees, the Burn Wallet will continue growing indefinitely from every transaction made for a coin/token. This Burn Wallet shows up as an existing holder on BSCScan when clicking on the Holders tab under any applicable coin or token.

During our initial fair-launch for EcoBitcoin, we immediately burned 42,000,000/84,000,000 (42 million of 84 million) $ECOBTC or approximately 50% of the Initial Supply. Since we burned 50% and have a higher-than-average 8% transaction fee that is auto-redistributed to holders through AirMining, our Burn Wallet will grow much faster through transactions than a majority of other tokens.

Tokenomics & Transaction Fees Info:
There is a 16% Total Transaction Fee on every buy/sell/transfer transaction that is split in two ways.
(1) 8% of each transaction fee is paired with BNB and automatically locked into EcoBitcoin‚Äôs PancakeSwap Liquidity Pool (LP), raising the price floor forever with every transaction. The more BNB increases in value over time, the more our Liquidity Pool will be worth. 99% of the EcoBitcoin LP Tokens were securely locked through DxSale for 4 years until June 23, 2025 within 24 hours after the initial launch as a promise to the community.
(2) 8% of each transaction fee is AirMined (or auto re-distributed) to all existing $ECOBTC holders through a revolutionary new AirMining process. The more EcoBitcoin you hold in your wallet, the more is AirMined directly to you instantaneously after each transaction.
